Response: Trees grow by producing new cells in a process called cell division. Growth happens in two main ways: primary growth (which makes the tree taller) and secondary growth (which makes the tree wider).

In primary growth, new cells are generated at the tips of twigs and roots, which make the tree grow taller or longer. This occurs in a region called the meristem. 

In secondary growth, special cells called cambium cells add new cells to the bark (outside layer of the trunk) and the wood (inside layer). This process thickens the trunk, branches, and roots of the tree. 

In addition, trees need sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide to carry out photosynthesis, the process of turning light energy into food. Nutrients and water are drawn up from the roots through the xylem, a system of tubes in the tree's trunk, and transported to the leaves. The leaves then use these resources (along with sunlight and carbon dioxide) to create glucose, a type of sugar that helps the tree grow. 

The process of growth varies among different species of trees and is influenced by environmental conditions such as light, temperature, and availability of nutrients and water.
