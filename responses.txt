Query: How many connections does each stop on the Yamanote Line have?
Response: The Yamanote Line in Tokyo, Japan, is a busy and important railway loop that serves many major commercial and residential areas of the city. The number of connections at each stop on the Yamanote Line varies, as some stations are much larger and more complex than others.

However, I can give you a general idea of the number of connections at each station on the Yamanote Line:

* Most stations on the Yamanote Line have at least 2-3 connections to other railway lines or subway lines.
* Some of the busier and more centrally located stations, such as Tokyo, Shinjuku, Shibuya, and Ikebukuro, have many more connections, with as many as 10-15 different lines serving each station.
* At the other end of the spectrum, some of the smaller and more suburban stations on the Yamanote Line may have only 1 or 2 connections to other lines.

It's worth noting that the exact number of connections at each station can change over time, as railway companies add or remove lines and services. So, while the above information should give you a rough idea of the number of connections at each stop on the Yamanote Line, it's always a good idea to check the latest information before traveling.
